## Problem-1: Orthotropic Material with Iso-cracks
Description: There are 3 cracks with normals along the global co-ordinate axes. The Dcr matrix is isotropic and the material is orthotropic (transversely isotropic to be precise)

* Contains UMAT files

## Problem-2: Orthotropic Material with Orthotropic cracks
Description: There are 3 cracks with normals along the global co-ordinate axes. The Dcr matrix and the material both are orthotropic (transversely isotropic to be precise)

* Contains UMAT files and a MATLAB file to validate analytic solutions with ABAQUS result
