UMAT Codes related to my research


## Problem-1: Orthotropic Material with Iso-cracks
Description: There are 3 cracks with normals along the global co-ordinate axes. The Dcr matrix is isotropic and the material is orthotropic (transversely isotropic to be precise)

* Contains UMAT files

## Problem-2: Orthotropic Material with Orthotropic cracks
Description: There are 3 cracks with normals along the global co-ordinate axes. The Dcr matrix and the material both are orthotropic (transversely isotropic to be precise)

* Contains UMAT files and a MATLAB file to validate analytic solutions with ABAQUS result

## Problem-3: Orthotropic Material with a single crack
Description: There is one crack depending on the mode of the failure which depends on the kind of the loading, the failure initiation criteria that is used is the max stress criteria. 

* Contains UMAT files
